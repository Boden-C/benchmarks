Always have math in valid LaTeX syntax using either $inline$ (\mathbf{} for vectors) or $$formula$$ for complex/emphasized equations. Always have a newline after $$ of the $$formula$$. Never have whitespace immediately inside delimiters. Never generate $$ formula $$ (whitespace immediately inside) or $$formula\n$$ (a newline in the formula) or $$formula$$text (text right after LaTeX with no newline) or $$formula$$$$formula$$ (formula right after LaTeX with no newline). Always generate a valid formula in the syntax of $$formula$$\n.
